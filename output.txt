The U.N. Security Council approved a resolution Monday to send 4,200 peacekeepers to Abyei, Sudan, as part of a recent agreement between Sudan and Southern Sudan. A week ago, the Sudanese government and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement signed an agreement to allow peacekeepers in Abyei, aimed at ending strife that has ravaged much of the country. The U.N. peacekeepers will "monitor and verify the redeployment of any Sudan Armed Forces, Sudan People's Liberation Army or its successor" from the Abyei area, among other tasks, the Security Council resolution states.
